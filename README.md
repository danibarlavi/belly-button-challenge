# belly-button-challenge
--This was the most conceptually icky challenge for class to date, but fascinating.

--Drew from these in-class codes:
  --StuPlotly
  --StuCreating Functions
  --StuSortandSlice
  --Stu_D3
  --InsDropDowns
  --InsEventListeners


I used ChatOpenAI for assistance with some language for plotly/D3 adn for troubleshooting when I had difficult rendering the bar graph correctly.
